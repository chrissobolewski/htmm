Prioritize your savings.

When you get your paycheck, it is tempting to start spending your money immediately. Plus, there's a list of bills waiting for you to pay.

But don't do that just yet. Your first obligation is to yourself. Before you start paying others (and thus helping them get richer), *pay yourself first* (and help yourself get richer).

Treat is as a bill that you need to pay to yourself. This is your commitment to start saving *something*. And stick to it every single month.

Once you set aside a sum for your [[Savings]], you can live on what's left. That means you will have less money available to spend every month -- and that's exactly the point. We're stopping [[Parkinsons Law]] in its tracks this way. 

### Make it easier, automate it
If you get your salary on a set day every month, you can make all this *pay yourself process* easier by automating it. Set a recurring transfer from your [[Checking account]] to your [[Saving account]] one day after the payday.

Sometimes, personal finance seems like a lot to manage, so every little thing that you can automate helps!
