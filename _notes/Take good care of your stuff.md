Take good care of your belongings. Maintain your stuff well instead of replacing it the next time it breaks (see: [[You don't need to upgrade]]).

This way your things to last you longer. And thatâ€™s important, especially for items that are nice/expensive.

Have fewer things in your life, but higher quality and lasting longer. [[Be smart about your expenses]] through minimizing the need for new purchases.
