Take good care of your belongings. Prioritize maintenance over upgrades (see: [[You don't need to upgrade]]).

This way your things to last you longer. And thatâ€™s important, especially if it's something nice/expensive.

You want fewer things in your life, but higher quality and lasting longer. [[Be smart about your spending]] through minimizing the need for new purchases.
