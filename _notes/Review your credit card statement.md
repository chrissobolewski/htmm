It's good practice to periodically review your [[Credit card]] statements (or credit card history in your banking app) to make sure everything checks out.

Everyone makes mistakes, banks too â€” so don't take for granted that everything on your statement is accurate. For instance, you might find fraudulent transactions, wrong payment amounts, or realize that the merchant never issued you a promised refund. If you catch such errors in time, you have a chance to make things right by issuing a [[Chargeback]] claim.

And if your credit card details were compromised, it's important to react quickly and prevent frauds from using your card. Call your card issuer immediately, report suspicious charges, and cancel your card if that happens.
