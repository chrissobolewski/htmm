One of [[Good financial habits]]

- Don't buy bottled water
- Don't pay for diminishing returns — after some point, the cost increase in quality increases exponentially.
- Avoid addictive substances.
- Take advantage of off-season sales (clothing)
	- But just the fact that some item is on sale is not a reason to buy it. Buy only things you need (or things that are important to you -> how to identify it?)
- Mark your calendar for predictable sales events (Black Friday)
- Souvenirs are not worth it, just take photos
- Extended warranty — don't pay extra for it; see if your credit card offers it as a part of the package
- Buy enough and not more — reduce waste
- Unnecessary fees — see if you can switch to a free bank account (usually online only)
- Review and cut your subscriptions (and you've probably canceled your gym subscription already because of corona?)
- Make coffee at home
- Big ticket items — huge opportunity for savings
	- If you need a car (huge money-sink), buy secondhand
- Buy things that make you money instead of things that make you spend even more
