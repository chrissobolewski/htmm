Keeping a personal budget (also known as family budget or home budget) is important for your financial health. After all, how can you tell whether your home finances are healthy if you don't know where your money is going every month?

Personal budget gives you a sense of **control over your money**. Once you know what you spend on, you can control it better. You can set limits and keep yourself accountable. The very fact of making a note of your each expense will make you spend less.

And with control comes **agency**. Through keeping a *personal budget* you're taking responsibility for your financial well-being and are taking active steps to improve it. That's empowering.

After a few months of budgeting you will have data that will let you **plan ahead**. Because keeping a budget is not only about recording the past (your expenses and income history) â€” it's also about getting a read of the *future*. 

You will know what your finances will look like in the next few months. And with that knowledge you will be able to plan your future expenses, [[Manage your cashflow]] better, and make a roadmap for growing your savings or managing your debt. Money will become more predictable.

This control, agency, knowledge, and predictability will help you reduce uncertainty and anxiety around money. See: [[Psychological benefits of saving money]].

Finally, build **momentum**. Keeping a *personal budget* is just a start. It's a foundation upon which you can build more [[Good financial habits]].
