Turn off personalized ads wherever you can. It's better for your privacy and will help you save money.

We all like to think that ads don't influence us. *I'm smarter than that!* We're being overly generous to ourselves. Ads make money. It's a billions-of-dollars industry for a reason. They work, even if you don't notice it.

Nowadays, social media sites and various apps will ask you to enable "personalized ads". They will tell you you will get an ad experience more tailored to your interests and you will see ads that are relevant to you.

But think about it.

First of all, it's creepy.

Second, why would you want to see ads "relevant to you"? The only reason companies want you to switch this setting on is that they know that personalized ads are more effective. They will have a better chance to sell you stuff.

Do you really want make this easy for them?

Keep your ads random and irrelevant and you will have less temptation to spend money on stuff you don't need.
