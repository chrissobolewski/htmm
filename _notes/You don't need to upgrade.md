You don't need the latest and greatest to live a better life.

And let's be honest — most new devices that come out these days offer only iterative improvements. There's no new groundbreaking use cases that they introduce, no new killer features. They're just a little bit nicer. A little bit more convenient to use. 

But your current phone/tablet/camera/computer works just fine! 

Chances are, you already have everything you need. So is it worth paying for just *a little bit better*? It won't make you happy (except for the initial dopamine burst at the moment of the purchase). And it doesn't make sense to sacrifice your [[Financial goals]] to spend a significant amount of money on a new device that offers only a slight improvement over your existing one.

### When to buy new stuff?
But hey — I'm not saying you shouldn't upgrade ever. It's just you need to learn to identify the right moment to do so. The fact that the new iPhone is out does *not* constitute a good reason to move on from the last year's model. 

Resist the reviews and the YouTube videos that make you drool over the new product. Don't give in to the noise. Focus on your real needs.

**Sometimes stuff breaks or wears out.** That's a good time to consider whether or not to replace it. But replacement is not your only option here. Can it be repaired? 

Think worn out battery in your iPhone — you can go to the Apple Store and replace it for a fraction of a cost of a new phone. That's usually the smartest choice: the best use of your money and the most noticeable quality of life improvement.

You can also go without. Ask yourself: *do I really need a device from this product category in my life?*

**You've outgrown your equipment.** This is the most satisfying way to upgrade. It's when you start to feel the limits of your gear. You begin to notice the device you have is no longer enough to deliver on your creative vision. You've hit the ceiling. You can't improve your craft unless you upgrade your equipment first.

Just be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking *I can't do X because I don't have the best Y*. More often than not, you do not need *the best* thing in its category. Instead, you should look for something *good enough* to bring your game to the next level. See also: [[Learn to live with things that are good enough]].

**Your gear has earned its replacement**. I call it *the test of value*. 

Check how much value you've extracted from your existing device. Do a simple calculation. Take your usage frequency (daily, a couple times a week, etc.), the price you paid, and the purchase date — and see how every day of using this device costs you.

> It's been 3 years and 2 months since I've purchased my iPad Pro 10.5". I use it every day. I paid HK$ 6,788.00 for it. So every day of use so far has cost me HK$ 5.76. I usually permit myself to *consider* an upgrade once the cost-per-use falls below HK$ 10.00.

The result of this calculation will give you a sense of the value that this specific thing is bringing into your life. It will show you what you use most often. And stuff you use the most is usually the most worthy of an upgrade:
- you use it often, so it wears down quicker, and
- you want it to be nice(r) because you interact with it often (nothing worse than a device that annoys you every day).
