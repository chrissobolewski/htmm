These are the [[Expenses]] that improve your quality of life. The *wants*, the *non-essentials*. Treats, toys, experiences, indulgences, pleasures.

It's okay to have them! They give life flavor, after all. If you were to limit yourself  to only *needs* and bare essentials, you'd just be *existing*. There's more to life than that.

As is often is with finance, you need to be reasonable here. Good rule of thumb is to not let *lifestyle expenses* (or "wants") exceed 30% of your after-tax income. See also: [[Minimalist personal budget]].

Be careful, though! â€” it's easy to fall into the trap of [[Lifestyle creep]] with these.
