Don't look for perfect. Don't look for best-in-class. It's usually a waste of time, a waste of money, and it doesn't make you happier. Quite the opposite (see: [The Power of Good Enough](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/the-power-of-good-enough/387388/)).

Do you really *need* to buy the best you can afford? There are some [[Expense categories]] where it makes sense, yes, but you should be *very* selective about it. And most of the time, the answer should be "no". [[Be smart about your expenses]].

And do you really have to this new thing at all? [[You don't need to upgrade]]. Certainly not every year. You don't need the latest and greatest to live a good life. Your existing devices probably work just fine.
