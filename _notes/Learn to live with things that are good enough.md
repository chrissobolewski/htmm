Don't look for perfect. Don't look for best-in-class. It's usually a waste of time, a waste of money, and it doesn't make you happier. Quite the opposite (see: [The Power of Good Enough](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/the-power-of-good-enough/387388/)).

Do you really *need* to buy the best you can afford? There are some [[Expense categories]] where it makes sense, yes, but you should be *very* selective about it. And most of the time, the answer should be "no". [[Be smart about your expenses]] and you will be happier -- [research shows](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/02/how-to-find-happiness/) that people who choose good enough are generally more optimistic, happier, and less regretful than people who look for best-in-class.

> The single most important piece of advice I can give is: Remember that good enough is almost always good enough. If people go through life looking for good enough results, the choice problem will take care of itself. Go through your day getting a good enough cup of coffee and a good enough toasted bagel and so on and so on and life will look much sunnier.

And do you really have to this new thing at all? [[You don't need to upgrade]]. Certainly not every year. You don't need the latest and greatest to live a good life. Your existing devices probably work just fine.
