*Fuck-you money*: having enough [[Savings]] so that you can say "fuck you" to your boss without worrying about the consequences.

While [[Emergency fund]] helps you when you're in trouble that's usually not your own doing (at least not directly), *fuck-you money* let's you "create trouble" and still be fine. Naturally, you need much more money for that than what's in a typical [[Emergency fund]].
