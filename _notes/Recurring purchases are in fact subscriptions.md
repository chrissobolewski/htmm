Think about the things you buy — not your everyday purchases but items that you buy every few months or every few years.

That new smartphone you buy every 2-3 years. Or a new computer every 5-7 years. Headphones, tables, peripherals... I'm enumerating electronics here because that's the category that's on top of my mind. But the main point applies to others just as easily. Home appliances, cars, even clothing.

And the main point is: think about your recurring purchases as subscriptions. Even if you pay the entire amount up front.

That $999 iPhone you buy every 3 years becomes a $27.75 per month affair.

Framing your purchases this way will help you get a clearer picture of your monthly expenses. It will also give you an idea of how much you should save in order to be able to afford your future purchases. Lastly, it will cushion the blow of buying big ticket items — instead of a one-time shock to your [[Personal budget]], the expense will be spread over time.

Try it. Look around, identify the items you're going to replace (see: [[You don't need to upgrade]]), and then see how much money you need to set aside each month to afford the purchase once the replacement is due.
