This is how you lose money every day. Does any of the below apply to you? Attack these bad habits one by one and you'll see the difference in your bank account almost immediately.

**Buying bottled water.** It's literally [thousands of times more expensive than tap water](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/about/live-healthy/tap-water-vs-bottled-water). Even if you have to buy water filters first, the investment will pay for itself in a short amount of time.

**Spending money on addictive substances.** Smoking costs a fortune. And it will get worse. Prices will keep going up — and so will your tolerance to nicotine (if you don't quit). Over time, you'll need to buy more for more. That's how most addictions work.

**Buying extended warranty.** It is often overpriced and the benefits are negligible. Instead of paying extra at the time of the purchase, check if your [[Credit card extended warranty]] covers it.

**Paying bank fees.** Just switch to an online-only account that is free of charge. Some banks or types of accounts may require you to hold a specific balance — but that's easy to do if you're going use that bank for your primary account.

**Carrying a credit card balance.** [[Always pay your credit card balance in full]].

**Having your daily coffee at a cafe.** It is *six times* less expensive to brew coffee at home. And that's with specialty, single origin beans. There's no downside. You can have *much* better quality coffee for *much* less money. Don't say no to that.

**Not negotiating.** Big-ticket items is where negotiating makes all the difference. It's a skill that will save you thousands of dollars in one single move. Negotiate when buying a car, buying a house, renting a new place, getting a mortgage. Don't know how? *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss is a good start.

**Letting your subscriptions get out of hand.** We're living in an age of subscriptions. Gym, food boxes, software, music, video, cinemas. Almost everything is a subscription now (see: [[Recurring purchases are in fact subscriptions]]). Track your recurring expenses. Check your subscriptions on a regular basis and make sure you're not paying for something you don't use.

**[[Lifestyle creep]].**
