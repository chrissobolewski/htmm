> Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst.

Unexpected [[Expenses]] happen. It might be a [[Health]] emergency, urgent car repair, job loss... And while we'd like to think such things don't happen to *us*, the unfortunate truth is that they sometimes do. So it *literally* pays to be prepared.

Be sure to build a robust *emergency fund* before you get into any [[Investments]]. At this stage, your [[Financial stability]] is more important than earning interest or dividends. 

## How much money do you need?
First, you need to [[Spend less than you make]] to generate [[Savings]] that you can put into your *emergency fund*.

As for the numbers... treat below as a rule of thumb. The exact amounts will depend on your situation: where you live, how much you make, your marital status, your age, your profession... Point is, there are a lot of variables. 

Regardless, keep the following milestones in mind.

### Step 1: one-month's worth of expenses
How much money do you spend in a month, on average? If you already have a [[Personal budget]], you will know. If you don't â€” start there. 

This is the amount you will need for this first step. It's meant to help you in a pinch. So that you don't need to go into [[Debt]] if your fridge breaks down or if you need to pay for a doctor's visit out of your pocket. 

It won't be enough to get you out of a major financial crisis, but it will help with small, annoying stuff.

Chances are, these will be your first [[Savings]]. You will soon learn how much of a confidence boost this is. You're finally changing things for the better! Most people don't even get to this step. See also: [[Psychological benefits of saving money]].

### Step 2: six-months' worth of expenses
Now you're thinking long-term. Growing your *emergency fund* so it can cover half-a-year of expenses will take a while. But keep the end-goal in mind: you're saving this money so that the next financial crisis, the next economic downturn won't bring you down. 

This money will also come in handy when/if you decide to quit your job and look for something new, perhaps even start your own business. 

Save this money, so you can sleep better even during tough times.

## Where to keep the money?
Remember, the goal of these [[Savings]] is to give you a sense of [[Financial stability]]. That's the priority, not the profit, not the [[Savings interest rate]]. So don't look for the best opportunity to invest this money. Instead, focus on access.

Now, here's a delicate balance to strike:
- You don't want this money to be immediately available. Why expose yourself to the temptation of tapping into this emergency fund every time you open your banking app?
- On the other hand, you should be able to access this money fast enough if there's is a real emergency.

The best and most surefire way is to put your *emergency fund* into a [[Saving account]] at a bank that is *not* your primary bank. You'll still be able to withdraw this money quickly in an emergency, but keep them out of sight when you don't need them.

And the interest rate? Just a cherry on top.

Whenever you take any money out of your *emergency fund*, remember to put it back in once the emergency is over and you can start saving again.
