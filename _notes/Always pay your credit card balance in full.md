Never carry a [[Credit card]] balance. Credit card interest rate is among the highest you can see in consumer [[Debt]]. If you pay less than the full amount you owe when your payment is due, you will be charged interest on the unpaid balance.

Moreover, if you usually pay less than the full amount, it can hurt your [[Credit score]] (see also: [[Credit cards and your credit score]]). 

If you can, set up auto-pay for the 100% of the credit card balance. This way you will never miss a payment and will not owe your bank any interest (for this one card, at least).
