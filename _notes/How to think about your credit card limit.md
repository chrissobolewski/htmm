You may think that [[Credit card]] limit is the money you can safely spend. *My bank made this money available to me so it's okay for me to spend this much* -- right?

Well... it is not. Such thinking will lead you into the [[Parkinson's Law]] trap. Your expenses will grow to max out your credit limit. And you don't want that.

The money you have available is the money you have allocated to spending in your [[Personal budget]] for this month. That's it.

The money in your credit limit? It's not your money, it belongs to the bank. You will have to pay it back in a month or two if you use it. 

The good way to think about spending money with your credit card is: spend as if you were to repay it today. This way you will always [[Spend less than you make]].
