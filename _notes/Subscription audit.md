Once in a few months it's good to make a subscription audit. Check all your recurring expenses, all the digital and offline services you pay for.

Collect your bills, go through your credit card statements, open the subscrptions page on [Apple Store](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/HT202039) or [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en), and search for "subscription" in your e-mail client. Once you have everything, make a list.

If it helps, you can use a subscription tracking app, such as [Bobby](https://www.bobbyapp.co/), create a spreadsheet in Excel or [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/spMr5Cwa), or just make a note. 

The goal is to see all your subscriptions in one place along with the monthly recurring costs. Subscriptions are a popular business model nowadays and it's easy for your monthly expenses to go out of hand because of having too many subscriptions.

Go through the items on your list one-by-one and cancel anything you no longer use (in most cases, you will still be able to use the service — and have to pay for it — until the end of the current billing period). Next, cancel anything you don't think you need. And anything that you think doesn't bring enough value into your life.

Keep only the subscriptions that are truly useful to you.

And knowing that [[Recurring purchases are in fact subscriptions]], check whether your future purchase plans are still up to date. Should you account for something new or — even better — take something out?
