Saving money is not about choosing a less expensive item every time. Cheap stuff will often cost you more than it says there on the price tag. 

Low price means there was a trade-off somewhere. It may not be obvious at a first glance but eventually you'll be paying more. In repair costs, health costs, time wasted, frustration, or in having to buy a replacement.

Instead of trying to spend less on everything, learn to [[Be smart about your expenses]]. Spend money *wisely*.
