Saving money is not about choosing a less expensive item every time. Cheap stuff will often cost you more than it says there on the price tag. Eventually, you'll be paying more in repair costs, in health costs, in time wasted, in having to buy a replacement.

Low price means there was a trade-off. And it may not be obvious at a first glance.

Instead of trying to spend less on everything, learn to [[Be smart about your expenses]]. Spend money *wisely*.
