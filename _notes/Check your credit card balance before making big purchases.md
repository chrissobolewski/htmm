Log in into your banking app or call your bank to check your credit [[Card balance]] if you're about to make a big purchase (or just plan to do a lot of shopping) with your card.

You just want to know you won't go over the credit limit (see also: [[How do credit cards work]]) and won't be charged over-the-limit fees (see also: [[Credit card fees]]).
