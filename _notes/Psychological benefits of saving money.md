Can you put a price tag on peace of mind? Well, [[Insurance]] companies certainly can. And when you think about it, your [[Savings]] are essentially your personal insurance (see also: [[Emergency fund]]). Except it makes you money (see also: [[Savings interest rate]]), instead of costing you in fees and premiums.

Peace of mind is one of the greatest psychological benefits of saving money.

Others include:
- increased confidence (see also: [[Fuck-you money]]) — if a storm comes, you'll be able to weather it
- increased assertiveness (you can literally afford to say “no” to more things and more people)
- more optimism — [[Financial stability]] gives you a clearer and more positive outlook
- less uncertainty
- less stress, money stops being a reason for worry

Saving money has a profound impact on your mental health.
