title: 30-day rule

If you want something, don't buy it on an impulse. Give yourself 30 days to consider this purchase. Three things can happen after that 30-day time period is over:

1. You'll still want it. Go ahead and buy it if you can afford it. 
2. You'll realize you're fine without it. No need to buy it.
3. You'll no longer want it. It was just an impulse. You saved money.

More often than not, it's either 2. or 3. Rarely 1.

The more expensive an item, the more important this rule is.
