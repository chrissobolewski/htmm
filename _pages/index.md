# Welcome! ðŸ’¸

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  This blog does not have a traditional table of contents. Instead, please feel free to explore. You will find some links below that should get you started with some fundamental concepts of [[Personal finance]] management.

  Every note here is a living document. New ideas, examples, and insights will be added over time. Make sure to visit often!
