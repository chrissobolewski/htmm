# 👋 Hi! I'm Chris. 

I've made this site to help you manage your money, grow your [[Savings]], make wise [[Investments]] decisions, and reach [[Financial stability]]. Start here, and take control of your [[Personal finance]] today!

This page is an extension to my Polish personal finance management blog, [Metafinanse](https://metafinanse.pl), that I've been running since 2012. I'm a big believer in raising people's financial awareness. Hope I will be able to reach international audience with this project.

### Why is this worth your time?
I've been teaching people personal finance management since 2012. I've helped my Polish readers get out of [[Debt]] and manage their [[Personal budget]]s better. After numerous suggestions from my friends and readers, I've launched this site in English.

This will be a valuable resource for you if you:
- need to take control of your finances and don't know where to start
- want to grow your [[Savings]] effectively
- need to get out of [[Debt]]
- want to learn more about [[Banking products]]
- seek advice on managing your [[Personal budget]]
- want to make more money, either through [[Investments]] or just [[Increasing your income]]

### Constant work in progress
Every note you see here is a [[Living document]]. I update this page constantly. This means you might see seams here and there. Like some phrases in `[[ ]]` brackets. In the future, they will lead to a separate page with further explanation. If you see the brackets, it's just means the target page is not ready yet (it will be, eventually).
