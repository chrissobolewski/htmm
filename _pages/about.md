# About this page

## üëã Hi! I'm Chris. 

I've made this site to help you manage your money, grow your [[Savings]], make wise [[Investments]] decisions, and reach your [[Financial goals]]. Start here, and take control of your money today!

I'm a big believer in raising people's financial awareness. This page is an extension to my Polish <a class="internal-link" href="/index">personal finance management</a> blog, [Metafinanse](https://metafinanse.pl), that I've been running since 2012. 

### Why is this worth your time?
I've been teaching people personal finance management since 2012. I've helped my Polish readers get out of [[Debt]] and manage their [[Personal budget]]s better. After numerous suggestions from my friends and readers, I've launched this site in English.

*howtomanage.money* will be a valuable resource for you if you:
- need to take control of your finances and don't know where to start
- want to grow your [[Savings]] effectively
- need to get out of [[Debt]]
- want to learn more about [[Banking products]]
- seek advice on managing your [[Personal budget]]
- want to make more money, either through [[Investments]] or just [[Increasing your income]]

I promise I will respect your time. My goal is to take the personal finance concepts (which can often seem complex and overwhelming) and explain them here with clarity and brevity.

I will also respect your privacy. You won't find any trackers from Facebook, Google, or anything like that on this site.

### Constant work in progress
üöß Every note you see here is a [Living document](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C). I update this page constantly. This means you might see seams here and there, like some phrases in `[[ ]]` brackets. In the future, they will lead to a separate page with further elaboration. But for now, if you see the brackets, it just means the target page is not ready yet (but it will be, eventually).
