# About this page

## 👋 Hi! I'm Chris. 

I've made this site to help you manage your money, grow your [[Savings]], make wise [[Investments]] decisions, and reach [[Financial stability]]. Start here, and take control of your money today!

This page is an extension to my Polish <a class="internal-link" href="/index">personal finance management</a> blog, [Metafinanse](https://metafinanse.pl), that I've been running since 2012. I'm a big believer in raising people's financial awareness. Hope I will be able to reach international audience with this project.

### Why is this worth your time?
I've been teaching people personal finance management since 2012. I've helped my Polish readers get out of [[Debt]] and manage their [[Personal budget]]s better. After numerous suggestions from my friends and readers, I've launched this site in English.

This will be a valuable resource for you if you:
- need to take control of your finances and don't know where to start
- want to grow your [[Savings]] effectively
- need to get out of [[Debt]]
- want to learn more about [[Banking products]]
- seek advice on managing your [[Personal budget]]
- want to make more money, either through [[Investments]] or just [[Increasing your income]]

I promise this page will respect your time. My goal here is to distill the personal finance concepts (which can often seem complex and overwhelming) into essentials. Expect brevity and clarity here.

I will also respect your privacy. You won't find here any trackers from Facebook, Google, or anything like that.

### Constant work in progress
🚧 Every note you see here is a [Living document](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C). I update this page constantly. This means you might see seams here and there. Like some phrases in `[[ ]]` brackets. In the future, they will lead to a separate page with further explanation. If you see the brackets, it just means the target page is not ready yet (it will be, eventually).
