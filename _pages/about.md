# 👋 Hi! I'm Chris. 

I made this site to help you manage your money, grow your [[Savings]], make wise [[Investments]] decisions, and reach [[Financial stability]]. Start here, and take control of your [[Personal finance]] today!

This page is an extension to my Polish personal finance management blog, [Metafinanse](https://metafinanse.pl), that I've been running since 2012. I'm a big believer in financial empowerement and awareness. Hope I will be able to reach international audience with this project.

📐 This site was built with the [Digital Garden Jekyll Template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com). It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
